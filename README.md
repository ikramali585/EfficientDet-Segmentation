# EfficientDet for Custom Segmentation

This project involves training the EfficientDet model for segmentation on a custom dataset. The segmentation head utilized in this project is based on the GitHub repository [EfficientDetDoesEAST](https://github.com/israelcamp/EfficientDetDoesEAST), while the rest of the inferencing and implementation were developed from scratch.

## Introduction
This project aims to leverage the EfficientDet architecture for segmentation tasks. By integrating the EfficientDet model with a custom segmentation head inspired by the EfficientDetDoesEAST repository, we aim to achieve efficient and accurate segmentation results on our custom dataset.

## Features
- EfficientDet-based segmentation
- Custom segmentation head
- End-to-end training and inferencing pipeline
- Support for custom datasets

## Inference
The inference pipeline is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. Simply provide the path to your input data and the trained model will generate segmentation results. The output will be saved in the specified directory.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
